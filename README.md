# Hybrid-Branch-Predictor-TAGE-Local-ML-Meta-Arbitration-
This repository contains a high-accuracy hybrid branch predictor combining TAGE, Local History, Perceptron ML, Meta-Chooser, Loop prediction, and Side-Channel bias units. The design is optimized for the CBP2 infrastructure and achieves competitive MPKI performance with modest storage (~1.65 MB implemented).
